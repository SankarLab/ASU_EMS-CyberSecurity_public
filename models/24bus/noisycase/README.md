## 24-bus model with noisy measurements

Contains:

* This is a set of PSM case files where noise has been introduced into the measurement set.
  * The noisy measurements were generated by a run of the ASU Matlab SE.  Noisy data and estimates were manually copied into the PSM CSV files.
  * Noise was added even on to 0-injection buses, so this set of CSV files adds loads that do not exist in the source 24-bus model in order to account for the noise.
* se-24bus-results.csv contains the measurement, noisy measurement, and estimates both from the java and ASU Matlab SE code.
